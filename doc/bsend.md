# NAME

 bsend - sends data to a socket

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

int bsend(
    int s,
    const void* buf,
    size_t len,
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 This function sends data to a bytestream socket. It is a blocking operation that unblocks only after all the data are sent. There is no such thing as partial send. If a problem, including timeout, occurs while sending the data error is returned to the user and the socket cannot be used for sending from that point on.

 **s**: The socket to send the data to.

 **buf**: Buffer to send.

 **len**: Size of the buffer, in bytes.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns 0. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **EBUSY**: The handle is currently being used by a different coroutine.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **ECONNRESET**: Broken connection.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid argument.
* **ENOTSUP**: The handle does not support this operation.
* **EPIPE**: Closed connection.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline was reached.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int rc = bsend(s, "ABC", 3, -1);
```
