 chmake - creates a channel

# ERRORS

* **EMFILE**: The maximum number of file descriptors in the process are already open.
* **ENFILE**: The maximum number of file descriptors in the system are already open.
* **ENOMEM**: Not enough memory.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int ch[2];
int rc = chmake(ch);
if(rc == -1) {
    perror("Cannot create channel");
    exit(1);
}
```
