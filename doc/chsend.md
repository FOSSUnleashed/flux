# NAME

 chsend - sends a message to a channel

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

int chsend(
    int ch,
    const void* val,
    size_t len,
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 Sends a message to a channel.

 The size of the message sent to the channel must match the size of the message requested from the channel. Otherwise, both peers fail with **EMSGSIZE** error.

 If there's no receiver for the message, the function blocks until one shows up or until the deadline expires.

 **ch**: The channel.

 **val**: Pointer to the value to send to the channel.

 **len**: Size of the value to send to the channel, in bytes.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns 0. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid argument.
* **EMSGSIZE**: The peer expected a different message size.
* **ENOTSUP**: The handle does not support this operation.
* **EPIPE**: Channel has been closed with chdone.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline was reached.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int val = 42;
int rc = chsend(ch, &val, sizeof(val), now() + 1000);
if(rc != 0) {
    perror("Cannot send message");
    exit(1);
}
printf("Value %d sent successfully.\n", val);
```
