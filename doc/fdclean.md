# NAME

 fdclean - erases cached info about a file descriptor

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

void fdclean(
    int fd);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 This function drops any state that libdill associates with a file descriptor. It has to be called before the file descriptor is closed. If it is not, the behavior is undefined.

 It should also be used whenever you are losing control of the file descriptor. For example, when passing it to a third-party library. Also, if you are handed the file descriptor by third party code you should call this function just before returning it back to the original owner.

 **fd**: file descriptor (OS-level one, not a libdill handle)

# RETURN VALUE

 None.

# ERRORS

 None.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int fds[2];
pipe(fds);
use_the_pipe(fds);
fdclean(fds[0]);
close(fds[0]);
fdclean(fds[1]);
close(fds[1]);
```
