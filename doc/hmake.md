# NAME

 hmake - creates a handle

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdillimpl.h>

struct hvfs {
    void *(*query)(struct hvfs *vfs, const void *type);
    void (*close)(int h);
    int (*done)(struct hvfs *vfs, int64_t deadline);
};

int hmake(
    struct hvfs* hvfs);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 A handle is the user-space equivalent of a file descriptor. Coroutines and channels are represented by handles.

 Unlike with file descriptors, however, you can use the **hmake** function to create your own type of handle.

 The argument of the function is a virtual-function table of operations associated with the handle.

 When implementing the **close** operation, keep in mind that invoking blocking operations is not allowed, as blocking operations invoked within the context of a **close** operation will fail with an **ECANCELED** error.

 To close a handle, use the **hclose** function.

 **hvfs**: virtual-function table of operations associated with the handle

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns newly created handle. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid argument.
* **ENOMEM**: Not enough memory.
