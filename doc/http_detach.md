# NAME

 http_detach - terminates HTTP protocol and returns the underlying socket

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

int http_detach(
    int s,
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 **WARNING: This is experimental functionality and the API may change in the future.**

 HTTP is an application-level protocol described in RFC 7230. This implementation handles only the request/response exchange. Whatever comes after that must be handled by a different protocol.

 This function does the terminal handshake and returns underlying socket to the user. The socket is closed even in the case of error.

 **s**: Handle of the SUFFIX socket.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

 This function is not available if libdill is compiled with **--disable-sockets** option.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns underlying socket handle. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **ECONNRESET**: Broken connection.
* **ENOTSUP**: The handle is not an HTTP protocol handle.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline was reached.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int s = tcp_connect(&addr, -1);
s = http_attach(s);
http_sendrequest(s, "GET", "/", -1);
http_sendfield(s, "Host", "www.example.org", -1);
http_done(s, -1);
char reason[256];
http_recvstatus(s, reason, sizeof(reason), -1);
while(1) {
    char name[256];
    char value[256];
    int rc = http_recvfield(s, name, sizeof(name), value, sizeof(value), -1);
    if(rc == -1 && errno == EPIPE) break;
}
s = http_detach(s, -1);
tcp_close(s);
```
