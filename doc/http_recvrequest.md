# NAME

 http_recvrequest - receives HTTP request from the peer

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

int http_recvrequest(
    int s,
    char* command,
    size_t commandlen,
    char* resource,
    size_t resourcelen,
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 **WARNING: This is experimental functionality and the API may change in the future.**

 HTTP is an application-level protocol described in RFC 7230. This implementation handles only the request/response exchange. Whatever comes after that must be handled by a different protocol.

 This function receives an HTTP request from the peer.

 **s**: HTTP socket handle.

 **command**: Buffer to store HTTP command in.

 **commandlen**: Size of the **command** buffer.

 **resource**: Buffer to store HTTP resource in.

 **resourcelen**: Size of the **resource** buffer.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

 This function is not available if libdill is compiled with **--disable-sockets** option.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns 0. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **ECONNRESET**: Broken connection.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid argument.
* **EMSGSIZE**: The data won't fit into the supplied buffer.
* **ENOTSUP**: The handle does not support this operation.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline was reached.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int s = tcp_accept(listener, NULL, -1);
s = http_attach(s, -1);
char command[256];
char resource[256];
http_recvrequest(s, command, sizeof(command), resource, sizeof(resource), -1);
while(1) {
    char name[256];
    char value[256];
    int rc = http_recvfield(s, name, sizeof(name), value, sizeof(value), -1);
    if(rc == -1 && errno == EPIPE) break;
}
http_sendstatus(s, 200, "OK", -1);
s = http_detach(s, -1);
tcp_close(s);
```
