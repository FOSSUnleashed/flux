# NAME

 http_sendstatus - sends HTTP status to the peer

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

int http_sendstatus(
    int s,
    int status,
    const char* reason,
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 **WARNING: This is experimental functionality and the API may change in the future.**

 HTTP is an application-level protocol described in RFC 7230. This implementation handles only the request/response exchange. Whatever comes after that must be handled by a different protocol.

 This function sends an HTTP status line to the peer. It is meant to be done at the beginning of the HTTP response. For example, if status is 404 and reason is 'Not found' the line sent will look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not found
```

 **s**: HTTP socket handle.

 **status**: HTTP status such as 200 or 404.

 **reason**: Reason string such as 'OK' or 'Not found'.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

 This function is not available if libdill is compiled with **--disable-sockets** option.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns 0. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **ECONNRESET**: Broken connection.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid argument.
* **ENOTSUP**: The handle does not support this operation.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline was reached.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int s = tcp_accept(listener, NULL, -1);
s = http_attach(s, -1);
char command[256];
char resource[256];
http_recvrequest(s, command, sizeof(command), resource, sizeof(resource), -1);
while(1) {
    char name[256];
    char value[256];
    int rc = http_recvfield(s, name, sizeof(name), value, sizeof(value), -1);
    if(rc == -1 && errno == EPIPE) break;
}
http_sendstatus(s, 200, "OK", -1);
s = http_detach(s, -1);
tcp_close(s);
```
