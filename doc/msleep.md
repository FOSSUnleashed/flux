# NAME

 msleep - waits until deadline expires

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

int msleep(
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 This function blocks until the deadline expires or an error occurs. In the former case it returns zero.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns 0. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int rc = msleep(now() + 1000);
if(rc != 0) {
    perror("Cannot sleep");
    exit(1);
}
printf("Slept succefully for 1 second.\n");
```
