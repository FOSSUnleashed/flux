# NAME

 udp_recvl - receives an UDP packet

# SYNOPSIS

```c
#include <libdill.h>

ssize_t udp_recvl(
    int s,
    struct ipaddr* addr,
    struct iolist* first,
    struct iolist* last,
    int64_t deadline);
```

# DESCRIPTION

 UDP is an unreliable message-based protocol defined in RFC 768. The size of the message is limited. The protocol has no initial or terminal handshake. A single socket can be used to different destinations.

 This function receives a single UDP packet.

 This function accepts a linked list of I/O buffers instead of a single buffer. Argument **first** points to the first item in the list, **last** points to the last buffer in the list. The list represents a single, fragmented message, not a list of multiple messages. Structure **iolist** has the following members:

```c
void *iol_base;          /* Pointer to the buffer. */
size_t iol_len;          /* Size of the buffer. */
struct iolist *iol_next; /* Next buffer in the list. */
int iol_rsvd;            /* Reserved. Must be set to zero. */
```

 When receiving, **iol_base** equal to NULL means that **iol_len** bytes should be skipped.

 The function returns **EINVAL** error in the case the list is malformed:

* If **last->iol_next** is not **NULL**.
* If **first** and **last** don't belong to the same list.
* If there's a loop in the list.
* If **iol_rsvd** of any item is non-zero.

 The list (but not the buffers themselves) can be temporarily modified while the function is in progress. However, once the function returns the list is guaranteed to be the same as before the call.

 **s**: Handle of the UDP socket.

 **addr**: Out parameter. IP address of the sender of the packet. Can be **NULL**.

 **first**: Pointer to the first item of a linked list of I/O buffers.

 **last**: Pointer to the last item of a linked list of I/O buffers.

 **deadline**: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the **now** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

 This function is not available if libdill is compiled with **--disable-sockets** option.

# RETURN VALUE

 In case of success the function returns size of the received message, in bytes. In case of error it returns -1 and sets **errno** to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine was canceled.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid argument.
* **EMSGSIZE**: The data won't fit into the supplied buffer.
* **ENOTSUP**: The handle does not support this operation.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline was reached.

# EXAMPLE

```c
struct ipaddr local;
ipaddr_local(&local, NULL, 5555, 0);
struct ipaddr remote;
ipaddr_remote(&remote, "server.example.org", 5555, 0, -1);
int s = udp_open(&local, &remote);
udp_send(s1, NULL, "ABC", 3);
char buf[2000];
ssize_t sz = udp_recv(s, NULL, buf, sizeof(buf), -1);
hclose(s);
```
